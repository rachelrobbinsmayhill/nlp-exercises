       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“In 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world—and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support—Time hailed her as “the face of change.” Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset, she tells her full story for the first time.”\n",

       "Female Innovators at Work: Women on Top of Tech by Danielle Newnham \n",
       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“This book describes the experiences and successes of female innovators and entrepreneurs in the still largely male-dominated tech world in twenty candid interviews. It highlights the varied life and career stories that lead these women to the top positions in the technology industry that they are in now.\n",
       "Interviewees include CEOs, founders, and inventors from a wide spectrum of tech organizations across sectors as varied as mobile technology, e-commerce, online education, and video games. Interviewer Danielle Newnham, a mobile startup and e-commerce entrepreneur herself as well as an online community organizer, presents the insights, instructive anecdotes, and advice shared with her in the interviews, including stories about raising capital for one’s start-up, and about the obstacles these women encountered and how they overcame them.”\n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "Technically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and Other Threats of Toxic Tech by Sara Wachter-Boettcher\n",
       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“Buying groceries, tracking our health, finding a date: whatever we want to do, odds are that we can now do it online. But few of us ask how all these digital products are designed, or why. It’s time we change that. Many of the services we rely on are full of oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares. Chatbots that harass women. Signup forms that fail anyone who’s not straight. Social media sites that send peppy messages about dead relatives. Algorithms that put more black people behind bars. \n",
       "Technically Wrong takes an unflinching look at the values, processes, and assumptions that lead to these problems and more. Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use – and demand more from the companies behind them.”\n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley by Emily Chang\n",
       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops for women in tech. Instead, it’s a “Brotopia,” where men hold the cards and make the rules. While millions of dollars may seem to grow on trees in this land of innovation, tech’s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world.\n",
       "Brotopia reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures even as its companies claim the moral high ground, and how women are speaking out and fighting back. Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao’s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they “won’t lower their standards” just to hire women. Exposing the flawed logic in common excuses for why tech has long suffered the “pipeline” problem and invests in the delusion of meritocracy, Brotopia also shows how bias coded into AI, internet troll culture, and the reliance on pattern recognition harms not just women in tech but us all, and at an unprecedented scale.”\n",

       " \n",
       "Life in Code: A Personal History of Technology by Ellen Ullman\n",
       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“The last twenty years have brought us the rise of the internet, the development of artificial intelligence, the ubiquity of once unimaginably powerful computers, and the thorough transformation of our economy and society. Through it all, Ellen Ullman lived and worked inside that rising culture of technology, and in Life in Code she tells the continuing story of the changes it wrought with a unique, expert perspective.\n",
       "When Ellen Ullman moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s and went on to become a computer programmer, she was joining a small, idealistic, and almost exclusively male cadre that aspired to genuinely change the world. In 1997 Ullman wrote Close to the Machine, the now classic and still definitive account of life as a coder at the birth of what would be a sweeping technological, cultural, and financial revolution.\n",
       "Twenty years later, the story Ullman recounts is neither one of unbridled triumph nor a nostalgic denial of progress. It is necessarily the story of digital technology’s loss of innocence as it entered the cultural mainstream, and it is a personal reckoning with all that has changed, and so much that hasn’t. Life in Code is an essential text toward our understanding of the last twenty years–and the next twenty.”\n",

       "AWS, Google, Azure, Red Hat, CompTIA…these are big names in IT! And not only for their products, but also for the certifications they offer. If you’re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What’s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won’t get you the job.\n",
       "What are IT Certifications?\n",
       "Certifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying “This person knows their stuff.” Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs.\n",
       "Why do IT Certifications matter to employers?\n",
       "Many roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don’t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Why do they matter to you?\n",
       "Obtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits:\n",
       "\n",
       "You will show up in recruiter searches on LinkedIn!\n",
       "You can follow specific, concrete paths for your career development\n",
       "You obtain industry-recognized, respected, and transferable credentials relevant for your whole career\n",
       "You develop relevant and broad-base content knowledge\n",
       "You will be able to pass initial HR screenings and land a seat in the interview\n",
       "\n",
       "Why DON’T they matter to employers and you?\n",
       "At the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you’re standing in the ring, it’s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting.\n",
       "Additionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it’s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don’t apply to most real-world software development.\n",
       "If Certs matter AND don’t matter, what do I do?\n",
       "At Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in – you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here’s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it’s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you’ll have the cert, but you’ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you’ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won’t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work.\n",
       "Alternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.\n",

       " 'contents': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAWS, Google, Azure, Red Hat, CompTIA…these are big names in IT! And not only for their products, but also for the certifications they offer. If you’re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What’s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won’t get you the job.\\nWhat are IT Certifications?\\nCertifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying “This person knows their stuff.” Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs.\\nWhy do IT Certifications matter to employers?\\nMany roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don’t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy do they matter to you?\\nObtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits:\\n\\nYou will show up in recruiter searches on LinkedIn!\\nYou can follow specific, concrete paths for your career development\\nYou obtain industry-recognized, respected, and transferable credentials relevant for your whole career\\nYou develop relevant and broad-base content knowledge\\nYou will be able to pass initial HR screenings and land a seat in the interview\\n\\nWhy DON’T they matter to employers and you?\\nAt the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you’re standing in the ring, it’s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting.\\nAdditionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it’s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don’t apply to most real-world software development.\\nIf Certs matter AND don’t matter, what do I do?\\nAt Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in – you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here’s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it’s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you’ll have the cert, but you’ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you’ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won’t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work.\\nAlternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.\\nIf you want to learn more about IT certification and training paths, reach out to us at info@codeup.com!\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n'}"

       "{'title': '5 Books Every Woman In Tech Should Read',\n",
       " 'contents': '\\nOn this International Women’s Day 2022 we wanted to tell stories about women in tech. What better way to do that than celebrate female authors! These women have written phenomenal books in the tech space to tell their stories. These are women who have walked the walk in the tech world and/or offered unique perspectives to not just women in tech, but women in the workplace. This list goes in no particular order as we believe you should add all of these to your kindle or book library asap. You can click on each book image to take you to a purchase page on Amazon.\\nLet’s dive into the list below:\\nReset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change by Ellen Pao\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“In 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world—and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support—Time hailed her as “the face of change.” Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset, she tells her full story for the first time.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFemale Innovators at Work: Women on Top of Tech by Danielle Newnham\\xa0\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“This book describes the experiences and successes of female innovators and entrepreneurs in the still largely male-dominated tech world in twenty candid interviews. It highlights the varied life and career stories that lead these women to the top positions in the technology industry that they are in now.\\nInterviewees include CEOs, founders, and inventors from a wide spectrum of tech organizations across sectors as varied as mobile technology, e-commerce, online education, and video games. Interviewer Danielle Newnham, a mobile startup and e-commerce entrepreneur herself as well as an online community organizer, presents the insights, instructive anecdotes, and advice shared with her in the interviews, including stories about raising capital for one’s start-up, and about the obstacles these women encountered and how they overcame them.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTechnically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and Other Threats of Toxic Tech by Sara Wachter-Boettcher\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“Buying groceries, tracking our health, finding a date: whatever we want to do, odds are that we can now do it online. But few of us ask how all these digital products are designed, or why. It’s time we change that. Many of the services we rely on are full of oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares. Chatbots that harass women. Signup forms that fail anyone who’s not straight. Social media sites that send peppy messages about dead relatives. Algorithms that put more black people behind bars.\\xa0\\nTechnically Wrong takes an unflinching look at the values, processes, and assumptions that lead to these problems and more. Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use – and demand more from the companies behind them.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBrotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley by Emily Chang\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops for women in tech. Instead, it’s a “Brotopia,” where men hold the cards and make the rules. While millions of dollars may seem to grow on trees in this land of innovation, tech’s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world.\\nBrotopia reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures even as its companies claim the moral high ground, and how women are speaking out and fighting back. Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao’s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they “won’t lower their standards” just to hire women. Exposing the flawed logic in common excuses for why tech has long suffered the “pipeline” problem and invests in the delusion of meritocracy, Brotopia also shows how bias coded into AI, internet troll culture, and the reliance on pattern recognition harms not just women in tech but us all, and at an unprecedented scale.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLife in Code: A Personal History of Technology by Ellen Ullman\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“The last twenty years have brought us the rise of the internet, the development of artificial intelligence, the ubiquity of once unimaginably powerful computers, and the thorough transformation of our economy and society. Through it all, Ellen Ullman lived and worked inside that rising culture of technology, and in Life in Code she tells the continuing story of the changes it wrought with a unique, expert perspective.\\nWhen Ellen Ullman moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s and went on to become a computer programmer, she was joining a small, idealistic, and almost exclusively male cadre that aspired to genuinely change the world. In 1997 Ullman wrote Close to the Machine, the now classic and still definitive account of life as a coder at the birth of what would be a sweeping technological, cultural, and financial revolution.\\nTwenty years later, the story Ullman recounts is neither one of unbridled triumph nor a nostalgic denial of progress. It is necessarily the story of digital technology’s loss of innocence as it entered the cultural mainstream, and it is a personal reckoning with all that has changed, and so much that hasn’t. Life in Code is an essential text toward our understanding of the last twenty years–and the next twenty.”\\n\\n\\xa0\\nLet us know your thoughts on this list on social media! What books or authors should we add to this list for a future post?\\nAre you a woman who is interested in launching your career in tech? Help us close the gender gap in tech and apply for our Women in Tech scholarship!

       "“In 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world—and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support—Time hailed her as “the face of change.” Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset, she tells her full story for the first time.”\n",

       "Female Innovators at Work: Women on Top of Tech by Danielle Newnham \n",
       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“This book describes the experiences and successes of female innovators and entrepreneurs in the still largely male-dominated tech world in twenty candid interviews. It highlights the varied life and career stories that lead these women to the top positions in the technology industry that they are in now.\n",
       "Interviewees include CEOs, founders, and inventors from a wide spectrum of tech organizations across sectors as varied as mobile technology, e-commerce, online education, and video games. Interviewer Danielle Newnham, a mobile startup and e-commerce entrepreneur herself as well as an online community organizer, presents the insights, instructive anecdotes, and advice shared with her in the interviews, including stories about raising capital for one’s start-up, and about the obstacles these women encountered and how they overcame them.”\n",

       "Technically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and Other Threats of Toxic Tech by Sara Wachter-Boettcher\n",
       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“Buying groceries, tracking our health, finding a date: whatever we want to do, odds are that we can now do it online. But few of us ask how all these digital products are designed, or why. It’s time we change that. Many of the services we rely on are full of oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares. Chatbots that harass women. Signup forms that fail anyone who’s not straight. Social media sites that send peppy messages about dead relatives. Algorithms that put more black people behind bars. \n",
       "Technically Wrong takes an unflinching look at the values, processes, and assumptions that lead to these problems and more. Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use – and demand more from the companies behind them.”\n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley by Emily Chang\n",
       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops for women in tech. Instead, it’s a “Brotopia,” where men hold the cards and make the rules. While millions of dollars may seem to grow on trees in this land of innovation, tech’s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world.\n",
       "Brotopia reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures even as its companies claim the moral high ground, and how women are speaking out and fighting back. Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao’s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they “won’t lower their standards” just to hire women. Exposing the flawed logic in common excuses for why tech has long suffered the “pipeline” problem and invests in the delusion of meritocracy, Brotopia also shows how bias coded into AI, internet troll culture, and the reliance on pattern recognition harms not just women in tech but us all, and at an unprecedented scale.”\n",

       "Life in Code: A Personal History of Technology by Ellen Ullman\n",
       "From the book’s description on Amazon:\n",
       "“The last twenty years have brought us the rise of the internet, the development of artificial intelligence, the ubiquity of once unimaginably powerful computers, and the thorough transformation of our economy and society. Through it all, Ellen Ullman lived and worked inside that rising culture of technology, and in Life in Code she tells the continuing story of the changes it wrought with a unique, expert perspective.\n",
       "When Ellen Ullman moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s and went on to become a computer programmer, she was joining a small, idealistic, and almost exclusively male cadre that aspired to genuinely change the world. In 1997 Ullman wrote Close to the Machine, the now classic and still definitive account of life as a coder at the birth of what would be a sweeping technological, cultural, and financial revolution.\n",
       "Twenty years later, the story Ullman recounts is neither one of unbridled triumph nor a nostalgic denial of progress. It is necessarily the story of digital technology’s loss of innocence as it entered the cultural mainstream, and it is a personal reckoning with all that has changed, and so much that hasn’t. Life in Code is an essential text toward our understanding of the last twenty years–and the next twenty.”\n",

       "AWS, Google, Azure, Red Hat, CompTIA…these are big names in IT! And not only for their products, but also for the certifications they offer. If you’re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What’s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won’t get you the job.\n",
       "What are IT Certifications?\n",
       "Certifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying “This person knows their stuff.” Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs.\n",
       "Why do IT Certifications matter to employers?\n",
       "Many roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don’t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Why do they matter to you?\n",
       "Obtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits:\n",
       "\n",
       "You will show up in recruiter searches on LinkedIn!\n",
       "You can follow specific, concrete paths for your career development\n",
       "You obtain industry-recognized, respected, and transferable credentials relevant for your whole career\n",
       "You develop relevant and broad-base content knowledge\n",
       "You will be able to pass initial HR screenings and land a seat in the interview\n",
       "\n",
       "Why DON’T they matter to employers and you?\n",
       "At the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you’re standing in the ring, it’s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting.\n",
       "Additionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it’s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don’t apply to most real-world software development.\n",
       "If Certs matter AND don’t matter, what do I do?\n",
       "At Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in – you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here’s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it’s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you’ll have the cert, but you’ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you’ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won’t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work.\n",
       "Alternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.\n",
